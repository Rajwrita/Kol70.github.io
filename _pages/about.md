Hi, I am Rajwrita Nath. I am a Computer Science Engineering student from Kolkata, India, currently in my second year. I have a passion for art, music and photography and I have always wanted to have a platform for me to grown and display the aesthetic and abstract side of me.

Kolkata 70, is my platform and venture to expand art and cultivate my passion for all things non-technical. Stay tuned for blogs, photographs, memories and more.
