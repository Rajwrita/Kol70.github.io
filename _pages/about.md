Hi, I am Rajwrita Nath. I am a Computer Science Engineering student from Kolkata, India, currently in my second year. I have a passion for art, music and photography and I have always wanted to have a platform for me to grow and display the aesthetic and abstract side of me.
Kolkata 70 houses photographs of random streets, motions, silences and noise. I also love writing and I have always wanted to put it out to the world in some way. 

Kolkata 70, is my platform and venture to expand art and cultivate my passion for all things non-technical.
I wish to explore art, build memories and spread smiles through this window. 

Stay tuned for blogs, photographs, memories and more.
