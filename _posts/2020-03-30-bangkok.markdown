_"She is an intriguing blend of simplicity and complexity.
A recipe to be loved, but never revealed."_

6.11.2018: 
There's something so strange about this city of Bangkok. It's not the huge malls or the abnormally sized Buddha (but gawd that was...h.u.g.e)... Somedays when you suddenly stop on some busy road and twirl by yourself you will find the sort of heart amidst all the rush. It's a place of dreams and smiles and unspoken wishes.
Most importantly this place, this day, this moment tells me that everything is so perfect.
It doesn't have to always be happy to be perfect and I wouldn't change a thing about it.
This right here is my milestone.
