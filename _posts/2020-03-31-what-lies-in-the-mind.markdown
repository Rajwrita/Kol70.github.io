 “Is it silly to love numbers and alphabets together? I think it isn’t…after all, poetry and mathematics are identical, one speaks for our heart and mind, the other for our brain; sense of beauty in poetry and mathematics is the result of our immediate and unconscious.
Fall in love with literary works as well as numbers, for, as you delve deeper and deeper, you’ll find the two to be one 'tricky - mind boggling – surreal' affair, so addictive that you’ll be obsessed with this unearthly world as much as I am.”
