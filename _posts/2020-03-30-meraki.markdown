*The eastern Indian city of Kolkata has been devastated by a powerful cyclone which has killed at least 84 people across India and Bangladesh. Amphan made landfall on Wednesday, lashing coastal areas with ferocious wind and rain. ... The storm is the first super cyclone to form in the Bay of Bengal since 1999.*

Kolkata 70 is my tiny venture for art, memories and more. I wish to expand it someday to build a ground for budding artists, to give them the exposure and platform to grow and cultivate what they love so deeply. And what better way to inaugurate this platform than sharing kindness and helping those in need ‚ù§

I have never wanted to put a price tag on my art for a very stringent reason. I am that person who loves the rush of work. Work which pays me for my efforts. I have seen the difference money des to lives and how it build or devastates. I have started working in multiple internships from my first year in college to make the most of my time. The paycheck at the end of the month keeps me driven and I undeniably live for that adrenaline rush. However, in this madness, art is one tiny and only place inmy life which is separated from this obnoxious hustle. I paint for the people I love, I paint with love and art keeps me genuinely calm and sane.

Ever since I was a kid, I always used to start painting when I was angry, upsetor confused and it kept me humble and sane. That safe place hasn't changed. Not at all. And i never wish to include the rush there. Because I know it will leave me with nothing to escape out to.

This platform is my place for sharing smiles. sharing kindness and bringing along people in this journey. The start to the journey:

Hence, *Day 1:* I keep a goal of raising 300/- and set out with making art work and post them to the various social media sites I was active on. Posts done, in comes 410 in the first 10 minutes. Excited, unexpected.

*Day2:* More money starts pouring in to the West Bengal State Relief Fund. A lot more than I expected. Tons of suuport, shares, love and acknowledgement. More kindness. 

*Day3:* I realise that there is a lot more stuff that I need to make now as the money is increasing. In comes hardwork. Tiny details- stickers, envelopes, handwritten notes for everyone and a lot of care and perfection.
 Yes, it did become overwhelming for me. But it made me so happy. Me and my best friend, Malisa, had this plan one night before going to bed. We could have never imagined to blow up so beautifully. 
 Slowly and steadily, envelopes kept increasing. Happy days :)
 
 *Day 4*: CLose to 1700/- collected, 15 envelopes. One adventure done, more to come :)
