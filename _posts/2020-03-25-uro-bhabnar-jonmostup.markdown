"Uro Bhabnar Jonmostup", a book by four college-goers, is an outcome of the experiences of life faced by these young minds. As the title suggests, the book is a collection of poems and a few short stories curling up from random thoughts on almost anything and everything - social dogmas, love and emotions, friendship, intellectualism and many more... The presentation of the poems is bound to awe the juveniles to the octagenarians. So get lost in the land of poetry with "Uro Bhabnar Jonmostup".
