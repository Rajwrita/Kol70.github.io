_"Every story has a time to be told, I convinced her. Otherwise you'll forever be a prisoner to the secret inside you."_
-Sputnik Sweetheart, Haruki Murakami.

Kolkata 70 is my bittersweet heaven. I've listened to a million stories and wrote down a million more. Kolkata 70, is ironically, an on-going story. Yet to be discovered to its full potential and experienced by none.
This platform is my attempt to portray this absurd cross section of hopes and dreams of mine and of the people who have stayed here.

One for the Road!
